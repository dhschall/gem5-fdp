scons: Reading SConscript files ...

You're missing the pre-commit/commit-msg hooks. These hook help to ensure your
code follows gem5's style rules on git commit and your commit messages follow
our commit message requirements. This script will now install these hooks in
your .git/hooks/ directory.
Press enter to continue, or ctrl-c to abort:
 Cannot find 'pre-commit'. Please ensure all Python requirements are 
installed. This can be done via 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
It is strongly recommended you install the pre-commit hooks before working with gem5. Do you want to continue compilation (y/n)?
